t4018 header: description of the test.
How to write test cases
=======================

Create test cases called "LANG-whatever" in this directory, where
"LANG" is e.g. the userdiff driver name, where "whatever" is a brief
description of the test.

Insert the word "ChangeMe" (exactly this form) at a distance of
at least two lines from the line that must appear in the hunk header.

Any line starting with "t4018" is a control line for the test:

 - The "t4018 header:" line above specifies what text must appear in
   the hunk header. We strip away the starting "@@ [...] @@" part of
   the line for ease of not having to hardcode the line numbers and
   offsets.

In many of the test cases the header line includes the token "RIGHT",
this used to be part of the test syntax, but isn't anymore. Now we
care about the "t4018 header:" line, not whatever line contains a
"RIGHT" token.
