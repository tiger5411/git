How to write test cases
=======================

There are two ways of writing tests in this directory. In both cases
"LANG" is the userdiff driver name, e.g. "perl" or "cpp".

The word "ChangeMe" (exactly this form) should appear at a distance of
at least two lines from the line that must appear in the hunk
header. See below sections.

t4018 header: t/README.
"LANG.sh" test cases
====================

These tests use the normal test-lib.sh syntax and environment, and are
sourced by t4018-diff-funcname.sh. The "test_diff_funcname()" function
is a thin wrapper around the "test_expect_success()" function. See
t/README.

The content of the "EOF_TEST" argument is used as-is, with the
exception of the "ChangeMe" token discussed above.

The advantage of using this over the "LANG-whatever" test cases (see
below) are:

 - The ability to do custom test setup/teardown, e.g. using
   "test_config" before the test is run.

 - The description of the test is a string, and doesn't need to be a
   valid filename.

 - All the tests for a given driver are present in one file. As
   demonstrated with the two "t4018 header" lines in this file this is
   also possible with the "LANG-whatever" tests, but those N tests in
   one file won't benefit from different test descriptions.

"LANG-whatever" test cases
==========================

Create test cases called "LANG-whatever" in this directory, where
"whatever" is a brief description of the test.

Any line starting with "t4018" is a control line for the test:

 - The "t4018 header:" line above specifies what text must appear in
   the hunk header. We strip away the starting "@@ [...] @@" part of
   the line for ease of not having to hardcode the line numbers and
   offsets.

In many of the test cases the header line includes the token "RIGHT",
this used to be part of the test syntax, but isn't anymore. Now we
care about the "t4018 header:" line, not whatever line contains a
"RIGHT" token.
