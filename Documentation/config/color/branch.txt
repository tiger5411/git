color.branch::
	A boolean to enable/disable color in the output of
	linkgit:git-branch[1]. May be set to `always`,
	`false` (or `never`) or `auto` (or `true`), in which case colors are used
	only when the output is to a terminal. If unset, then the
	value of `color.ui` is used (`auto` by default).

color.branch.<slot>::
	Use customized color for branch coloration. `<slot>` is one of
	`current` (the current branch), `local` (a local branch),
	`remote` (a remote-tracking branch in refs/remotes/),
	`upstream` (upstream tracking branch), `plain` (other
	refs).
