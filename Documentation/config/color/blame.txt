color.blame.highlightRecent::
	Specify the line annotation color for `git blame --color-by-age`
	depending upon the age of the line.
+
This setting should be set to a comma-separated list of color and
date settings, starting and ending with a color, the dates should be
set from oldest to newest. The metadata will be colored with the
specified colors if the line was introduced before the given
timestamp, overwriting older timestamped colors.
+
Instead of an absolute timestamp relative timestamps work as well,
e.g. `2.weeks.ago` is valid to address anything older than 2 weeks.
+
It defaults to `blue,12 month ago,white,1 month ago,red`, which
colors everything older than one year blue, recent changes between
one month and one year old are kept white, and lines introduced
within the last month are colored red.

color.blame.repeatedLines::
	Use the specified color to colorize line annotations for
	`git blame --color-lines`, if they come from the same commit as the
	preceding line. Defaults to cyan.
