include::url/base.insteadOf.txt[]

url.<base>.pushInsteadOf::
	Any URL that starts with this value will not be pushed to;
	instead, it will be rewritten to start with <base>, and the
	resulting URL will be pushed to. In cases where some site serves
	a large number of repositories, and serves them with multiple
	access methods, some of which do not allow push, this feature
	allows people to specify a pull-only URL and have Git
	automatically use an appropriate URL to push, even for a
	never-before-seen repository on the site.  When more than one
	pushInsteadOf strings match a given URL, the longest match is
	used.  If a remote has an explicit pushurl, Git will ignore this
	setting for that remote.
