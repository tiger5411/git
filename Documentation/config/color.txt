color.advice::
	A boolean to enable/disable color in hints (e.g. when a push
	failed, see `advice.*` for a list).  May be set to `always`,
	`false` (or `never`) or `auto` (or `true`), in which case colors
	are used only when the error output goes to a terminal. If
	unset, then the value of `color.ui` is used (`auto` by default).

color.advice.hint::
	Use customized color for hints.

color.interactive::
	When set to `always`, always use colors for interactive prompts
	and displays (such as those used by "git-add --interactive" and
	"git-clean --interactive"). When false (or `never`), never.
	When set to `true` or `auto`, use colors only when the output is
	to the terminal. If unset, then the value of `color.ui` is
	used (`auto` by default).

color.interactive.<slot>::
	Use customized color for 'git add --interactive' and 'git clean
	--interactive' output. `<slot>` may be `prompt`, `header`, `help`
	or `error`, for four distinct types of normal output from
	interactive commands.

color.pager::
	A boolean to specify whether `auto` color modes should colorize
	output going to the pager. Defaults to true; set this to false
	if your pager does not understand ANSI color codes.

color.remote::
	If set, keywords at the start of the line are highlighted. The
	keywords are "error", "warning", "hint" and "success", and are
	matched case-insensitively. May be set to `always`, `false` (or
	`never`) or `auto` (or `true`). If unset, then the value of
	`color.ui` is used (`auto` by default).

color.remote.<slot>::
	Use customized color for each remote keyword. `<slot>` may be
	`hint`, `warning`, `success` or `error` which match the
	corresponding keyword.

color.transport::
	A boolean to enable/disable color when pushes are rejected. May be
	set to `always`, `false` (or `never`) or `auto` (or `true`), in which
	case colors are used only when the error output goes to a terminal.
	If unset, then the value of `color.ui` is used (`auto` by default).

color.transport.rejected::
	Use customized color when a push was rejected.

color.ui::
	This variable determines the default value for variables such
	as `color.diff` and `color.grep` that control the use of color
	per command family. Its scope will expand as more commands learn
	configuration to set a default for the `--color` option.  Set it
	to `false` or `never` if you prefer Git commands not to use
	color unless enabled explicitly with some other configuration
	or the `--color` option. Set it to `always` if you want all
	output not intended for machine consumption to use color, to
	`true` or `auto` (this is the default since Git 1.8.4) if you
	want such output to use color when written to the terminal.
