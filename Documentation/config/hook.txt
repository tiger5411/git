hook.<command>.command::
	A command to execute during the <command> hook event. This can be an
	executable on your device, a oneliner for your shell, or the name of a
	hookcmd. See linkgit:git-hook[1].

hookcmd.<name>.command::
	A command to execute during a hook for which <name> has been specified
	as a command. This can be an executable on your device or a oneliner for
	your shell. See linkgit:git-hook[1].

hookcmd.<name>.skip::
	Specify this boolean to remove a command from earlier in the execution
	order. Useful if you want to make a single repo an exception to hook
	configured at the system or global scope. If there is no hookcmd
	specified for the command you want to skip, you can use the value of
	`hook.<command>.command` as <name> as a shortcut. The "skip" setting
	must be specified after the "hook.<command>.command" to have an effect.

hook.jobs::
	Specifies how many hooks can be run simultaneously during parallelized
	hook execution. If unspecified, defaults to the number of processors on
	the current system.
