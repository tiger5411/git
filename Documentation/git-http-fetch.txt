NAME
----
git-http-fetch - Utility for linkgit:git-fetch-pack[1] to download static files


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git http-fetch' [-v] --packfile=checksum --index-pack-args=<arg>... <URL>

DESCRIPTION
-----------

This command is used by linkgit:git-fetch-pack[1] to download static
files over the HTTP and HTTPS protocols.

OPTIONS
-------
--packfile=<hash>::
	For internal use only. Instead of a commit id on the command
	line (which is not expected in
	this case), 'git http-fetch' fetches the packfile directly at the given
	URL and uses index-pack to generate corresponding .idx and .keep files.
	The hash is used to determine the name of the temporary file and is
	arbitrary. The output of index-pack is printed to stdout. Requires
	--index-pack-args.

--index-pack-args=<args>::
	For internal use only. The command to run on the contents of the
	downloaded pack. Arguments are URL-encoded separated by spaces.

HISTORY
-------

In the past it used to support a `-w <ref> <commit> <url>` to download
a repository at a given `<url>` and update a given `<ref>` to a given
`<commit>` ID (OID), along with a `--stdin` mode to do the same for a
batch of refs and OIDs.

These options were once used by an early version of
linkgit:git-clone[1] and some ancient third-party tools to do what's
now more easily done via linkgit:git-fetch[1].
