NAME
----
scalar - an opinionated repository management tool

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
scalar register [<enlistment>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Scalar is an opinionated repository management tool. By creating new
repositories or registering existing repositories with Scalar, your Git
experience will speed up. Scalar sets advanced Git config settings,
maintains your repositories in the background, and helps reduce data sent
across the network.

An important Scalar concept is the enlistment: this is the top-level directory
of the project. It usually contains the subdirectory `src/` which is a Git
worktree. This encourages the separation between tracked files (inside `src/`)
and untracked files, such as build artifacts (outside `src/`). When registering
an existing Git worktree with Scalar whose name is not `src`, the enlistment
will be identical to the worktree.

The `scalar` command implements various subcommands, and different options
depending on the subcommand.

COMMANDS
--------

Register
~~~~~~~~

register [<enlistment>]::
	Adds the enlistment's repository to the list of registered repositories
	and starts background maintenance. If `<enlistment>` is not provided,
	then the enlistment associated with the current working directory is
	registered.
+
Note: when this subcommand is called in a worktree that is called `src/`, its
parent directory is considered to be the Scalar enlistment. If the worktree is
_not_ called `src/`, it itself will be considered to be the Scalar enlistment.
