Different but compatible licenses may apply to individual files or
directories. Defer to files matching "*COPYING*" or "*LICENSE*" in
subdirectories for the license of files therein, or to copyright

Examples include "sha1dc/LICENSE.txt" covering the imported "sha1dc/"
directory (and optional "sha1collisiondetection/" submodule), the
"xdiff/" directory licensed under the LGPL v2.1 (see the "LGPL-2.1"
file), and imported external code such as "compat/regex/".
